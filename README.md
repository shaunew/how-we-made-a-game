How we made a game
==================

__TL;DR__: Took 9 months to make the game [Pterodactyl
Attack](http://youtu.be/uDx9aQIYfP8?t=30s) from scratch with no experience.
Now I'm sharing how.

### Intro

Hello, I'm [Shaun](http://twitter.com), the programmer for __Pterodactyl
Attack__, an indie game for iOS/Android.  We at Hygoon worked on this title
from Jan 2013 to Sep 2013.  It will be released soon on App Store, and later on
Google Play.

The game and tools were developed from scratch in __javascript__ for __HTML5
Canvas2D__.  The code will be made free and open source some time after its
release, a la _id software_.

I find the experience of developement to be as interesting as the resulting
game itself.  So here are some articles that I am currently working on.
