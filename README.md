Pterodactyl Attack - Articles
=============================

Hello, I'm [Shaun](http://twitter.com/shaunewilliams) am the programmer for
Pterodactyl Attack, an indie game for iOS/Android.  We at Hygoon worked on this
title from Jan 2013 to Sep 2013.  It will be released soon.

The game was developed from scratch in Javascript for HTML5 Canvas2D.  The code
will be made free and open source some time after its release, a la _id
software_.

This was our first game.  I feel compelled to write these articles because I
find the experience of developement to be at least as interesting as the game
itself.

(These articles are a work in progress and will be published to
[http://hygoon.com](http://hygoon.com) when completed.)
