# Tutorial Design

Teaching the user how to play the game presents an interesting challenge that
we will talk about here.

## The main menu

The player actually cannot leave the Main Menu without learning how to shoot
pterodactyls.  So it serves as a mini-introduction to the mechanic.

## Deciding on a Tutorial Level

There are some games that are very good at teaching the player how to play the
game without explicitly tell them how to do so ([very good reference
here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM)).  The design of the first
levels plays a big role in easing the user into the game.  A well-designed
intro level can cause a player to learn and experience things about the game in
isolated manner to prepare them for harder levels later.

We decided to create a separate tutorial level, a sort of isolated environment
for spelling out exactly how the mechanics work, since there were only four
things to learn.  And there is no level design to speak of.  The game is only
driven by pterodactyl attack patterns over a mostly static background.

## One step at time

The tutorial is composed of four small tests. Each will repeat with an
audiovisual notification on what went wrong if the player failed.

### Hit Flaplings Twice

### Hit Adults Three Times

### Capture a Pterodactyl

### Earn Health by Capturing Correct Colors

## No distractions

The tutorial arena is designed to be colorless and minimal so that all
attention is focused on the pterodactyls flying at you.
