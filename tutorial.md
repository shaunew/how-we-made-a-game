# Tutorial Design

This section covers how we teach the player how to play the game.

## The main menu

The player actually cannot leave the Main Menu without learning how to shoot
pterodactyls.  So it serves as a mini-introduction to the mechanic.  Tapping on
either of the pterodactyls shows a short instruction animation shown below:

## Deciding on a Tutorial Level

Though there are [great examples](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM)
of how to teach the player with clever level design, we decided to create a
separate tutorial level, a sort of isolated environment for spelling out
exactly how the mechanics work.

## Focusing

The tutorial is composed of four small tests. Each will repeat with an
audiovisual notification on what went wrong if the player failed.  The arena is
designed to be colorless and minimal so that all attention is focused on the
pterodactyls flying at you.
