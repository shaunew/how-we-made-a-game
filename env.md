# Environment Backgrounds

The environments in our game consist of layered vector images that support
linear animated movement, collision detection, and parallax motion from phone
rotation.

## Environment Types

At the time of this writing, we have three different environments: mountain,
ice, and volcano.  You can see the layer composition of each below.

Each environment has an entrance/exit animation, collision geometry, and
parallax information that determines how each of its layers moves when rotating
your phone.
