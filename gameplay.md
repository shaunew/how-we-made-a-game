# Gameplay Design

What follows is an explanation of how we tried to build a fun game around a
simple firing mechanic.

## Starting with simple shooting

The game started with just a single mechanic of firing bullets.  The accuracy
and speed of your bullets was the only determing factor for how well you were
doing in the game.  Frankly, this mechanic didn't have any excitement.  It was
interesting in and of itself, but it made for very stale gameplay.

## Adding the capture mechanic

I realized that in this simple game, if the player dies, it was only because
they weren't shooting fast enough.  I don't think that's a compelling enough
reason to continue playing.

I postulated that the player has to feel a sense that they could've done
something better.  So I brainstormed different ways to force the player to make
decisions about what they were doing, so that they could improve strategies for
reaching better decisions in the game.

The capture mechanic was the method I settled on for creating these "decision
moments" in the game.  You can either shoot or capture a pterodactyl.  You
can frantically shoot them down as before, especially when there's too much
on the screen.  But you can also methodically capture correct colored ones
in order to improve your health.

The context switching between strategic capturing and frantic shooting created
a much more interesting experience that encourages the player to choose wisely
when to be calm and when to be frantic.  It's a decision strategy that enriched
an otherwise dull experience.

## Attack Patterns

(Talk about attack intervals)

## Adjusting the difficulty

Designing a good difficulty curve is rather difficult.  The problem of
balancing accessibility and pacing is probably best addressed by creating
separate difficulty levels.  This may be something I continue experimenting
with, but I settled on having an initially difficult game to encourage you to
get better.  It seems to be designed well for someone with responsive motor
skills who can connect their thoughts to their actions in the game.

Super Hexagon comes to mind when trying to justify the initial difficulty.  But
Hexagon is a very well designed game whose elements are certainly missing for
Pterodactyl Attack.

## Changes in scenery

The game changes scenery after every wave.  The effect serves the pacing of the
game well in the beginning, creating a perception of progress early on.  Though
this effect is lost in the later stages, I believe the saturation of level
rotations is quelled by the difficulty and resulting desire for a breath of air
between waves.

## A personal note on creating a compelling game

What follows is more of a philosophical peek into my thoughts on why I decided
against achievements and other decorative tactics employed in game design.

### Options for decorating a mechanic

There seems to be many ways to make a simple game more compelling.  You can
supplement it with an interesting narrative, engage the senses more with
audiovisual embellishments, add another complementary game mechanic, add more
concrete numbers/awards to focus compulsions of self-improvement, etc.

### Defining Fun vs Compulsion

I started with a simple goal of wanting to make the game more "fun".  But some
of the options I started thinking about seemed more geared toward adding
"compulsion".  That was when definitions started getting blurry.

I have my own opinions on what roles our games should play in our society, as
most others do.  So my own compass has steered me to rank the aforementioned
options in terms of the type of behavior I think it will promote in its players
and the type of nourishment that experience provides them.
