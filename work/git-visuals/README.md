Git Visualizations
==================

This is the page that I used to generate the Git visualizations for this project.

### Getting timestamps from Git

To generate the `commit-timestamps.json` file, I execute this rather long
shell one-liner from the project's root directory:

```shell
git log --date=raw | grep "^Date:" | awk 'BEGIN { print "{";i=0} i>0 { print ","} { i++; printf "\"%s\":1", $2} END { print "}"}' > commit-timestamps.json
```

#### Open Source versions based on Github's Designs

The design of these graphs are from Github's provided visualization for public
repositories.  I cannot use them for my private (but soon to be open source)
repository, so this is a collection of open source implementations.

## Calendar Heatmap

The heatmap uses the [Cal-Heatmap](http://kamisama.github.io/cal-heatmap/) project,
which is a customizable and open source implementation of the [Github
Contributions](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions)
calendar.

(I added the hour axis labels on the left in Gimp)

## Punchcard Graph

The punchcard is generated by the `punchcard.html` page in this folder.  It is
an implementation of Github's
[Punchcards](http://dustin.sallings.org/2009/01/11/timecard.html).
